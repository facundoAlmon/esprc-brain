# 🚗 ESP-RC Brain: The Open Source Brain for Your RC Car

Welcome to the ESP-RC Brain repository! This project is the brain of a smart radio-controlled car, built on a powerful ESP32 microcontroller. Here you will find everything you need to bring your own vehicle to life: the firmware, the 3D models, and an incredible web application for you to take control from any browser.

This is not just an RC car, it is an open platform for you to experiment, learn and, above all, have a great time!

## ✨ Key Features

-   **Total and Flexible Control:**
    -   **Bluetooth:** Connect your favorite Bluetooth joystick or gamepad (PS3, PS4, PS5, Xbox, etc.) and drive with precision thanks to the [Bluepad32](https://github.com/ricardoquesada/bluepad32) library.
    -   **Wi-Fi:** Use the integrated web application to control every aspect of the car from your phone, tablet, or PC.

-   **Connectivity Modes:**
    -   **Access Point (AP):** The car creates its own Wi-Fi network for you to connect directly, ideal for use anywhere.
    -   **Client Mode:** Connect the car to your existing Wi-Fi network for greater convenience at home.

-   **Movement Programming:** Turn your car into a programmable robot!
    -   **Sequence Editor:** From the "Program" tab, you can create custom movement sequences. Add steps like "Forward," "Turn Right," or "Wait" and adjust the duration of each in milliseconds.
    -   **Kid's Programming Mode:** A visual and super-simplified interface where children can drag and drop command blocks (forward, backward, turn, honk) to create their own programs easily and intuitively.
    -   **Real-Time Recording and Playback:**
        -   **Record Maneuvers:** Press the record button in the interface and just drive. The system will log your every move, whether you use the virtual joysticks or a Bluetooth gamepad.
        -   **Indicator Light:** An LED on the car will flash red to indicate that recording is active.
        -   **Save and Execute:** Recorded programs and those created in the editor can be saved to the ESP32's memory, exported/imported as JSON files, and run whenever you want, specifying the number of repetitions or in an infinite loop.

-   **Comprehensive and Intuitive Web Application:**
    -   **Two Joystick Styles:** Choose between a unified joystick or two separate levers (tank style).
    -   **Real-Time Configuration:** Adjust the maximum speed, minimum starting speed, servo alignment, turning limits, and more—all from the browser and instantly!
    -   **Advanced LED Light Control:** Customize your car's lights (WS2812B). Create LED groups and assign them functions like position light, brake, reverse, turn signals, interior light, or underglow. The configuration can be imported and exported.
    -   **System Management:** Restart the ESP32 or restore factory settings with a single click.

-   **Robust and Open Firmware:** Written in C++ on the official Espressif framework (ESP-IDF), ensuring professional-level performance and stability.

## 🔩 3D Models

All the 3D models used to print the chassis and body of the car are in the `Models` folder. Inside it, you will find more detailed instructions in the `README.MD` file.

- **[See details of the 3D models](./Models/README.MD)**

## 🚀 First Steps

Ready to build? Here we explain how to get everything up and running.

### Prerequisites

1.  **Hardware:**
    - An ESP32 microcontroller (an ESP32 or an ESP32-C6 can be used).
    - WS2812 LEDs if you want to use the lights.
    - DC motor driver. Tested with L298N
    - DC motor/s (for acceleration)
    - Servo motor (for steering)
    - Power supply:
      - I am currently using 3 18650 batteries connected to a battery protector. And a Step-Down regulator to lower the voltage to 5v for the ESP32 and the Servo Motor.
2.  **Software:**
    -   [ESP-IDF](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32/get-started/index.html): The Espressif development environment.
    -   [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/): To manage and compile the web application. (Only necessary if you want to modify the webapp)
    -   [Git](https://git-scm.com/): To clone the repository.

### Prepare the Firmware (ESP32)

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    It is very important to use the `--recursive` option to also download the necessary submodules (like Bluepad32).
    ```bash
    git clone --recursive https://gitlab.com/falmon/esprc-brain.git
    cd esprc-brain-c6/Firmware
    ```

2.  **Configure the project:**
    Open the ESP-IDF configuration menu to adjust specific parameters of your hardware if necessary.
    ```bash
    idf.py menuconfig
    ```

3.  **Compile the firmware:**
    This command will compile all the C++ code and prepare it to be transferred to the ESP32.
    ```bash
    idf.py build
    ```

4.  **Flash the ESP32:**
    Connect your ESP32 via USB and run the following command. Remember to change `/dev/ttyUSB0` to the corresponding serial port on your system.
    ```bash
    idf.py -p /dev/ttyUSB0 flash monitor
    ```
    This command flashes the firmware and opens a serial console so you can see the diagnostic messages in real time.

### WebApp Development (Optional)

If you want to modify the web interface, follow these steps. The webapp uses **Gulp.js** to package all the code (HTML, CSS, JS) into a single file that is integrated into the firmware.

1.  **Navigate to the webapp folder:**
    ```bash
    cd esprc-brain-c6/Firmware/webapp
    ```

2.  **Install the dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Useful commands:**
    -   `npm run build` or `gulp`: Compiles the webapp. This command packages and minifies the files from `src/` and copies the resulting `index.html` into the `Firmware/main/` folder, ready to be included in the firmware.
    -   `npm run serve`: Starts a local server to test the webapp in your browser without having to flash the ESP32.
    -   `npm run clean`: Deletes the files generated by the compilation.

> **Note:** After modifying the webapp and compiling it with `npm run build`, you must recompile and flash the ESP32 firmware for the changes to take effect on the car.

## 🔧 User Guide

### First Connection

By default, the ESP32 starts in **Access Point (AP) Mode**.

1.  **Connect to the Wi-Fi network:** On your phone or PC, look for a Wi-Fi network called **"ESP-RC-CAR"** and connect to it.
2.  **Open the web interface:** Open your browser and go to the address [http://ecar.local](http://ecar.local) or [http://192.168.4.1](http://192.168.4.1).
3.  **Let's drive!** You are now in the control interface. From the **"Connection"** tab, you can switch to Client mode so that the car connects to your local Wi-Fi network.

### Bluetooth Joystick Connection

1. Put the joystick in pairing mode
2. Make sure you have bluetooth enabled in the **Car Configuration** section
3. The ESP32 will automatically connect to the joystick
